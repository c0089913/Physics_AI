# Physics_AI
Coursework for demonstrating physics and AI in a game engine.
The objective was to develop a level which emulates a screwball scramble toy for physics, and show an AI system using behavior trees and state machines. It was also instructed to use states to manage game states.
The final demonstration is available here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGBqYz2Ynf8
